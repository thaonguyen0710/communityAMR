"Treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive infections (MRSA, VISA, VRSA) in children.","Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of both community and hospital acquired severe and life threatening infections such as bacteremia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, cellulitis, and pneumonia. Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is defined as oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >4 mcg/mL, and has increased in prevalence worldwide as both a healthcare-associated and a community-associated pathogen. Vancomycin is the treatment of choice for all invasive MRSA infections especially in life threatening ones in children. A number of community associated MRSA isolates remain susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/ sulphametoxazole (TMP-SMX). In communities the prevalence of MRSA colonization and infection is high (>10 percent) and the prevalence of clindamycin resistance is low (<10 percent) clindamycin may be used for empiric therapy. Vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) is defined as a vancomycin MIC 4 to 8 mcg/mL and vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) MIC >16 mcg/mL. VISA strains have variable susceptibility patterns to linezolid, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, rifampin, TMP-SMX and tetracycline. VISA and VRSA isolates have usually been found susceptible to linezolid, quinopristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin. However clinical experience of quinopristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin in children are limited.",['Hacimustafaoglu M'],,EXCLUDE,"The abstract appears to be a general review or overview of MRSA characteristics, treatment considerations, and resistance patterns rather than reporting original research data. It lacks any description of study design, population recruitment methods, or specific results from a defined sample. Inclusion criteria require original research reporting AMR prevalence in community populations, which this abstract does not demonstrate."
Getting hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae on the radar screen.,"Purpose Of Review: Two pathotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae cause human infections, classical (cKp) and hypervirulent (hvKp) K. pneumoniae. The present understanding of genetic elements, the need for an accurate test to identify hvKp, the clinical implications of infection, the knowledge gap on how and why hvKp colonization transitions to infection, and potential infection prevention and control issues for hvKp are discussed.Recent Findings: Infections because of hvKp are increasingly recognized worldwide. Its ability to cause organ and life-threatening disease in healthy individuals from the community merits concern, which has been magnified by increasing descriptions of multiply drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. Increased capsule and siderophore production by hvKp relative to cKp are critical virulence traits. Asians are most commonly infected, but whether this is mediated by a genetic susceptibility, or increased exposure and colonization is unknown. Specific studies about the epidemiology and transmission of hvKp are lacking, but precautions are appropriate for MDR/XDR strains and perhaps all infected/colonized individuals.Summary: hvKp is evolving into an increasingly concerning pathogen, in part because of the development of XDR strains. An accurate test to identify hvKp is needed for optimal clinical care, epidemiological, and research studies. An improved understanding of how infection develops, if a genetic susceptibility exists, and appropriate infection prevention and control measures also are needed.","['Sellick, John A.', 'Russo, Thomas A.']",,EXCLUDE,"The abstract is a review article discussing current knowledge about hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, including AMR concerns, but does not present original research or report specific AMR prevalence data.

"Epidemiological and clinical characterization of community, healthcare-associated and nosocomial colonization and infection due to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in Spain.","Background: Community-acquired (CA) and healthcare-associated (HCA) infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) are not well characterized. The objective was to provide detailed information about the clinical and molecular epidemiological features of nosocomial, HCA and CA infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp) and Escherichia coli (CP-Ec). Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in 59 Spanish hospitals from February to March 2019, including the first 10 consecutive patients from whom CP-Kp or CP-Ec were isolated. Patients were stratified according to acquisition type. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify the impact of acquisition type in 30-day mortality. Results: Overall, 386 patients were included (363 [94%] with CP-Kp and 23 [6%] CP-Ec); in 296 patients (76.3%), the CPE was causing an infection. Acquisition was CA in 31 (8.0%) patients, HCA in 183 (47.4%) and nosocomial in 172 (48.3%). Among patients with a HCA acquisition, 100 (54.6%) had been previously admitted to hospital and 71 (38.8%) were nursing home residents. Urinary tract infections accounted for 19/23 (82.6%), 89/130 (68.5%) and 42/143 (29.4%) of CA, HCA and nosocomial infections, respectively. Overall, 68 infections (23%) were bacteremia (8.7%, 17.7% and 30.1% of CA, HCA and nosocomial, respectively). Mortality in infections was 28% (13%, 14.6% and 42.7% of CA, HCA and nosocomial, respectively). Nosocomial bloodstream infections were associated with increased odds for mortality (adjusted OR, 4.00; 95%CI 1.21–13.19). Conclusions: HCA and CA infections caused by CPE are frequent and clinically significant. This information may be useful for a better understanding of the epidemiology of CPE.","['Salamanca-Rivera, Elena', 'Palacios-Baena, Zaira R.', 'Cañada, Javier E.', 'Moure, Zaira', 'Pérez-Vázquez, María', 'Calvo-Montes, Jorge', 'Martínez-Martínez, Luis', 'Cantón, Rafael', 'Ruiz Carrascoso, Guillermo', 'Pitart, Cristina', 'Navarro, Ferran', 'Bou, Germán', 'Mulet, Xavier', 'González-López, Juan José', 'Sivianes, Fran', 'Delgado-Valverde, Mercedes', 'Pascual, Álvaro', 'Oteo-Iglesias, Jesús', 'Rodríguez-Baño, Jesús', 'Martínez Ramírez, Mariela']",,EXCLUDE,"The study focuses on patients with infections caused by CPE (including community-acquired cases), but all participants were recruited through hospitals.

Seroprevalence of Typhoid Fever and Its Associated Risk Factors Among Clinically Diagnosed Febrile Patients Visiting the Outpatient Department at Debark Hospital and Drug Susceptibility Patterns of Isolates.,"Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, which poses major health problems in developing countries, including Ethiopia. However, there is limited information regarding typhoid fever, contributing factors with it, and its drug susceptibility pattern in the research area. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of typhoid fever and its associated risk factors among clinically diagnosed febrile patients at Debark Hospital and evaluate the drug susceptibility patterns of the isolates. A hospital‐based cross‐sectional study was conducted among 158 febrile patients from December 2022 to April 2023. Blood and stool samples were collected from each febrile patient. The Widal test was used to test Salmonella Typhi O and H antigens sera from blood, and bacteria were cultured from the stool. Gram staining and biochemical analyses were carried out for each isolate. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for the isolates using Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion techniques. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for analysis. In this study, the seroprevalence of typhoid fever among febrile patients at Debark Hospital was 22.8%. Gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02, 0.31, p ≤ 0.001), marital status (AOR: 95% CI: 2.63, 4.66, p ≤ 0.001), family size (AOR: 95% CI: 0.01, 0.31, p ≤ 0.001), residence (AOR: 95% CI: 0.09, 0.83, p = 0.021), practice of using toilet (AOR: 95% CI: 0.08, 0.086, p = 0.027), washing fruits and vegetables before eating (AOR: 95% CI: 0.12, 0.87, p = 0.025), and awareness of typhoid fever transmission and prevention (AOR: 95% CI: 0.12, 0.91, p = 0.032) are the associated risk factors for typhoid fever. Fifty percent of the isolates showed multidrug resistance to two or more antibiotics. It was suggested that improving personal hygiene, providing safe drinking water, and careful use of antibiotics could considerably reduce the prevalence of typhoid fever in the study area.","['Muleta, Atsede', 'Meseret, Naod', 'Komatsu, Haruki']",,EXCLUDE,"The study population consists of clinically diagnosed febrile patients recruited from a hospital setting, specifically seeking care for symptoms (fever) potentially related to Salmonella Typhi infection.

Wound colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and hypotheses about acquisition routes in rural health care settings in Sub-Saharan Africa: Perspective from a center devoted to the treatment of cutaneous neglected tropical diseases.,We identified a high prevalence (46.4%) of wound colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in patients hospitalized in a center devoted to the treatment of cutaneous tropical diseases in Benin. The proportion of MRSA among S aureus isolates was 54.3%. Thirty percent of these MRSA were identified in outpatients. The analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated an important diversity of strains but also identified 8 small clusters containing between 2 and 4 isolates suggesting cross-transmission. • Almost half of patients' wounds were colonized with MRSA. • Total 30% of MRSA were identified in outpatients. • Diversity of MRSA isolates according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. • Several small clusters suggest direct or cross-transmission inside the center. • Need for rural African health care settings to refer to a microbiology laboratory.,"['Nicol, Thomas', 'Declerck, Charles', 'Le Gallo, Morgane', 'Bougeard, Camille', 'Habib, Akimat', 'Catraye, Périn', 'Adeye, Ambroise', 'Boccarossa, Alexandra', 'Dubée, Vincent', 'Marsollier, Laurent', 'Marion, Estelle', 'Johnson, Roch Christian', 'Eveillard, Matthieu']",,EXCLUDE,"The study focuses on patients (both hospitalized and outpatients) from a center treating cutaneous tropical diseases, which suggests participants were seeking care for wound-related issues likely linked to infections.

Antibiotic de-escalation in pneumonia with pharmacist education and ordering of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus nasal swabs.,"Introduction When methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the causative pathogen in pneumonia, in-hospital mortality rate is approximately 31.2%. However, the occurrence of MRSA pneumonia is uncommon, with a reported incidence of approximately 4.2%. Vancomycin is often empirically used for MRSA pneumonia coverage, but can lead to serious harm. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of a pharmacy-driven MRSA nares testing protocol on vancomycin and linezolid prescribing patterns and clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with pneumonia after removal of immediate educational intervention. Methods This single-centre, quasi-experimental study evaluated the use of a MRSA nasal swab on patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia. This study consisted of three phases, the preimplementation phase, the active/educational phase and the postimplementation phase. The primary outcome was intravenous anti-MRSA antibiotic duration of therapy. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of acute kidney injury, duration of hospital stay, number of vancomycin levels obtained, the number of MRSA nares swabs ordered and time points in the MRSA nares collection process. Results The preimplementation phase (n=39), the active phase (n=45) and the postimplementation phase (n=26) demonstrated similar baseline characteristics. The primary outcome for duration of anti-MRSA therapy 0-72 hours was 61.5% vs 77.8% vs 76.9% (p=0.19). Acute kidney injury was decreased throughout the study at 25.6%, 24.4% and 16.7% (p=0.32). The number of MRSA nares swabs ordered were 23.1%, 60% and 30.8% in each of the phases, respectively (p=0.49). Discussion Our novel approach to measuring the impact of pharmacist education and ordering of MRSA nasal swabs has demonstrated benefits that were sustained for a short period after the intervention was removed. Additional study is required to determine the long-term impact. Conclusion The implementation of a hospital-wide anti-MRSA protocol in patients with confirmed or suspected pneumonia indicated sustained changes for at least 3 months after direct intervention.","['Doan, Kevin', 'Smoke, Steven']",,EXCLUDE,"The study population includes hospitalized patients (those with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia), which falls under exclusion criteria for hospitalized patients.

Influence of Peanut Consumption on the Gut Microbiome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Background: Peanut consumption could impact cardiometabolic health through gut microbiota, a hypothesis that remains to be investigated. A randomized clinical trial in Vietnam evaluated whether peanut consumption alters gut microbiome communities. Methods: One hundred individuals were included and randomly assigned to the peanut intervention and control groups. A total of 51 participants were provided with and asked to consume 50 g of peanuts daily, while 49 controls maintained their usual dietary intake for 16 weeks. Stool samples were collected before and on the last day of the trial. After excluding 22 non-compliant participants and those who received antibiotic treatment, 35 participants from the intervention and 43 from the control were included in the analysis. Gut microbiota composition was measured by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Associations of changes in gut microbial diversity with peanut intervention were evaluated via linear regression analysis. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze associations of composition, sub-community structure, and microbial metabolic pathways with peanut intervention. We also performed beta regression analysis to examine the impact of peanut intervention on the overall and individual stability of microbial taxa and metabolic pathways. All associations with false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values of <0.1 were considered statistically significant. Results: No significant changes were found in α- and β-diversities and overall gut microbial stability after peanut intervention. However, the peanut intervention led to lower enrichment of five phyla, five classes, two orders, twenty-four metabolic pathways, and six species-level sub-communities, with a dominant representation of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Escherichia coli D, Holdemanella biformis, Ruminococcus D bicirculans, Roseburia inulinivorans, and MGYG-HGUT-00200 (p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.1). The peanut intervention led to the short-term stability of several species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii F and H, and a metabolic pathway involved in nitrate reduction V (p < 0.05; FDR < 0.1), known for their potential roles in human health, especially cardiovascular health. Conclusions: In summary, a 16-week peanut intervention led to significant changes in gut microbial composition, species-level sub-communities, and the short-term stability of several bacteria, but not overall gut microbial diversity and stability. Further research with a larger sample size and a longer intervention period is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the direct impact of gut-microbiome-mediated health effects of peanut consumption.

Multidrug-resistant isolates from Ukrainian patients in a German health facility: a genomic surveillance study focusing on antimicrobial resistance and bacterial relatedness.,"Purpose: Antimicrobial resistance is a pressing issue in Ukraine, with healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms being a major concern. A recent prospective multicenter study revealed a staggering rate of 48.4% antimicrobial resistance to carbapenems among Enterobacterales causing a healthcare-associated infection. We conducted a systematic survey to investigate the incidence rate and incidence density of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (CPGN) among refugees and war-wounded Ukrainians in connection with the German health system. Methods: From the onset of the war until November 2022, seven Ukrainian patients were admitted to our hospital. Upon admission, screening samples and samples from the focus of suspected infection were taken from all seven patients. The incidence rate and the incidence density of CPGN were calculated as a result of the microbiological findings. We sequenced all CPGN using Illumina technology. Results: The incidence rate of CPGN at our hospital was 0.06 for 2021 and 0.18 for 2022. All seven Ukrainian patients were infected or colonized with at least one CPGN, including K. pneumoniae (14/25), P. aeruginosa (6/25), A. baumannii (1/25), Providencia stutartii (1/25), C. freundii (1/25), and E. coli (2/25). Genomic surveillance revealed that (i) most frequently detected carbapenemases among all sequenced isolates were blaNDM (17/25) and blaOXA-48 (6/25), (ii) most commonly observed plasmid replicons among the K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from Ukrainian patients were Col(pHAD28) (12/14), IncHI1B(pNDM-MAR) (9/14), IncFIB(pNDM-Mar) (12/14), and (iii) clonal relation between the pathogens of the Ukrainian isolates, but not for the isolates from our hospital surveillance system. Conclusion: The rising prevalence of community-acquired colonization and infection with CPGN is having a direct effect on the infection prevention measures, such as higher number of isolations, reprocessing of patient rooms, additional microbiological testing and overall organization within hospitals.","['Stein, Claudia', 'Zechel, Maria', 'Spott, Riccardo', 'Pletz, Mathias W.', 'Kipp, Frank']",,EXCLUDE,"The study population consists of hospitalized Ukrainian patients (refugees and war-wounded) admitted to a German hospital, which falls under the exclusion criteria for hospitalized patients. Additionally, samples were taken upon hospital admission for suspected infections, making this a clinical patient population seeking care rather than a community-based sampling. While the pathogens (K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, etc.) and AMR reporting meet outcome criteria, the hospitalized population and clinical context disqualify it."
Effectiveness of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surveillance among exposed roommates in community hospitals: Conventional culture versus direct PCR.,"Roommates of unrecognized nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases are at a higher acquisition risk; however, optimal surveillance strategies are unknown. Using simulation, we analyzed surveillance testing and isolation strategies for MRSA among exposed hospital roommates. We compared isolating exposed roommates until conventional culture testing on day 6 and a nasal polymerase chain reaction test on day 3 (PCR3) with/without day 0 culture testing (Cult0). The model represents MRSA transmission in medium-sized hospitals using data and recommends best practices from the literature and Ontario community hospitals. Cult0 + PCR3 incurred a slightly lower number of MRSA colonizations and 38.9% lower annual cost in the base case compared to Cult0 + culture testing on day 6 because the reduced isolation cost compensated for the increased testing cost. The reduction in MRSA colonizations was due to a 54.5% drop in MRSA transmissions during isolation as PCR3 reduced the exposure of MRSA-free roommates to new MRSA carriers. Removing the day 0 culture test from Cult0 + PCR3 increased total cost, the number of MRSA colonization, and missed cases by $1,631, 4.3%, and 50.9%, respectively. Improvements were higher under aggressive MRSA transmission scenarios. Adopting direct nasal polymerase chain reaction testing for determining post-exposure MRSA status reduces transmission risk and costs. Day 0 culture would still be beneficial. • Exposed roommates of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases are at high acquisition risk. • We analyzed MRSA surveillance and isolation strategies among exposed roommates. • We developed a computer simulation model to mimic transmission and progression. • Using nasal polymerase chain reaction testing for MRSA surveillance reduces transmission risk and costs. • Day 0 culture test on top of day 3 polymerase chain reaction test is beneficial for MRSA surveillance.","['Lin, Ru', 'Akgun, Esma', 'Erenay, Fatih Safa', 'Alev, Sibel Alumur', 'Ciccotelli, William A.']",,EXCLUDE,"The study focuses on hospitalized patients (roommates of nosocomial MRSA cases) and evaluates surveillance strategies in a hospital setting.

Community-acquired antimicrobial resistance among Syrian refugees and the local population in Türkiye.,"Background The long-standing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pandemic has proven difficult to resolve and is becoming more complex, especially in the context of increasing forced migration, with little evidence around patterns of AMR in migrant communities. This study aimed to determine the frequency in the carriage of common types of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria between Syrian refugees and the local communities in Türkiye: extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Methods We collected nasal swabs and stool samples from the study participants, the local community members, and refugees, between September 2020 and March 2021. We screened clinical samples for the presence of ESBL, MRSA and VRE. Antimicrobial-resistant bacterial isolates were tested by phenotypic analysis to determine the AMR status. Results The study included a total of 3960 participants: 1453 individuals in the local community (36.2%) and 2525 Syrian refugees (63.8%). Overall, a significantly greater proportion of refugees (6.7%) carried MRSA compared to the local community (3.2%) (P  < 0.001). The ESBL-positivity rate was 17.9% in Syrian refugees and 14.3% in the local community (P  = 0.041). Carbapenemase activity was detected in three isolates from Syrian refugees. No VRE was detected in Syrian refugees or the local community. Conclusions This large, community-based study on the frequency and the distribution of AMR among Syrian refugees and the local population is the first study in Türkiye.","['Yıldız, Serap Süzük', 'Hekimoğlu, Can Hüseyin', 'Sucaklı, Mustafa Bahadır', 'Bakkaloğlu, Zekiye', 'Çevik, Yasemin Numanoğlu', 'Ünaldı, Özlem', 'Arslantürk, Hayal', 'Zikusooka, Monica', 'Keçik, Melda', 'Nellums, Laura', 'Elci, Omur Cinar']",,INCLUDE,"The study involves community-based sampling of refugees and local populations, meeting the primary population criteria.

Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales Infections and Their Association with Rectal Colonization.,"Objective: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections have limited treatment options, and these infections are associated with high mortality rates. Asymptomatic carriers colonized with CRE contribute to the spread of CRE in hospitals. It was aimed to determine the frequency of CRE isolates detected in our center, carbapenemase ratios in these strains, carbapenemase genes, antibiotic resistance profiles, rectal CRE colonization rates and to evaluate various clinical features of CRE infections. Methods: Enterobacterales species isolated from various specimens and Enterobacterales species isolated from rectal swab specimens sent for colonization screening were examined. Patients with CRE colonization in rectal swab samples were examined for the development of CRE infection at a later time. CRE isolates were examined for carbapenemase production and the presence of carbapenemase gene. Results: 14521 Enterobacterales (10161 E. coli and 4195 K. pneumoniae, 165 Citrobacter) isolates were examined. Carbapenem resistance was detected in 8.9% of these strains. CRE was detected in 4.7% of 15695 rectal swab samples evaluated for colonization. In 23.4% of the patients with CRE colonization, CRE growth was detected in other samples besides the rectal swab in the later period. It was observed that CRE infections developed on average 21 days after colonization. Conclusions: CRE infections have started to emerge as a factor not only in hospitalized patients but also in community-acquired infections. Our study also showed that CRE colonization could be a significant risk factor for the development of infection. Therefore, early screening detection to detect colonization can help prevent or limit CRE infections with appropriate isolation methods.","['Aydemir, Ozlem', 'Koroglu, Mehmet', 'Ormanoglu, Gokcen', 'Ayhanci, Tugba', 'Aydemir, Yusuf', 'Guclu, Ertugrul']",,MAYBE,"The study reports CRE colonization and resistance data in Enterobacterales (which are priority pathogens).

Pathogen spectrum of community acquired pneumonia in people living with HIV (PLWH) in the German CAPNETZ-Cohort.,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the pathogen spectrum of community acquired pneumonia in people living with HIV (PLWH), and to compare it with a matched HIV negative group in order to reassess therapeutic strategies for PLWH. Methods: Seventy-three (n = 73) PLWH (median CD4 3–6 months before CAP: 515/µl; SD 309) with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) were matched with 218 HIV-negative CAP controls in a prospective study design. Pathogen identifications used blood culture, samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract (culture and multiplex PCR) and urinary pneumococcal and legionella antigen test. Results: Although the vaccination rate among PLWH with CAP was significantly higher (pneumococcal vaccination: 27.4 vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001; influenza vaccination: 34.2 vs. 17.4%, p = 0.009), pneumococci were found most frequently as pathogen among both PLWH (n = 19/21.3%) and controls (n = 34/17.2%; p = 0.410), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (PLWH, n = 12/13.5%, vs. controls, n = 25 / 12.6%; p = 0.850). Staphylococcus aureus was found equally in 20.2 and 19.2% in PLWH and controls, but infection or colonization could not be distinguished. Mortality during 6-month follow-up was significantly higher for PLWH (5/73, or 6.8%) versus controls (3/218, or 1.4%), however with lower case numbers than previously reported. Typical HIV-associated pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii were found only exceptionally. Conclusions: Our study underscores the persistent clinical burden of CAP for PLWH. From pathogen perspective, empirical antibiotic treatment for CAP in PLWH on antiretroviral therapy should cover pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae and may be adopted from valid common recommendations.","['Schleenvoigt, Benjamin T.', 'Ankert, Juliane', 'Barten-Neiner, Grit', 'Voit, Florian', 'Suttorp, Norbert', 'Boesecke, Christoph', 'Hoffmann, Christian', 'Stolz, Daiana', 'Pletz, Mathias W.', 'Rohde, Gernot', 'Witzenrath, Martin', 'Panning, Marcus', 'Essig, Andreas', 'Rupp, Jan', 'Degen, Olaf', 'Stephan, Christoph', 'Dreher, M.', 'Cornelissen, C.', 'Knüppel, W.', 'Creutz, P.']",,EXCLUDE,"The study population consists of individuals with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which falls under ""clinical patients specifically seeking care for infections related to the studied pathogens"" (exclusion criterion).

A comparison of passive and active dust sampling methods for measuring airborne methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pig farms.,"Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics. Pigs are an important reservoir of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA), which is genetically distinct from both hospital and community-acquired MRSA. Occupational exposure to pigs on farms can lead to LA-MRSA carriage by workers. There is a growing body of research on MRSA found in the farm environment, the airborne route of transmission, and its implication on human health. This study aims to directly compare two sampling methods used to measure airborne MRSA in the farm environment; passive dust sampling with electrostatic dust fall collectors (EDCs), and active inhalable dust sampling using stationary air pumps with Gesamtstaubprobenahme (GSP) sampling heads containing Teflon filters. Paired dust samples using EDCs and GSP samplers, totaling 87 samples, were taken from 7 Dutch pig farms, in multiple compartments housing pigs of varying ages. Total nucleic acids of both types of dust samples were extracted and targets indicating MRSA (femA, nuc, mecA) and total bacterial count (16S rRNA) were quantified using quantitative real-time PCRs. MRSA could be measured from all GSP samples and in 94% of the EDCs, additionally MRSA was present on every farm sampled. There was a strong positive relationship between the paired MRSA levels found in EDCs and those measured on filters (Normalized by 16S rRNA; Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.94, Not Normalized; Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.84). This study suggests that EDCs can be used as an affordable and easily standardized method for quantifying airborne MRSA levels in the pig farm setting.","['Rittscher, Anne E', 'Vlasblom, Abel A', 'Duim, Birgitta', 'Scherpenisse, Peter', 'Schothorst, Isabella J van', 'Wouters, Inge M', 'Gompel, Liese Van', 'Smit, Lidwien A M']",,EXCLUDE,"The study focuses on MRSA in pig farm environments and occupational exposure to farm workers, who are listed as an excluded population (occupational groups with unique exposures like animal handlers/farmers).

High-level Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Enterobacterales Among Individuals in a Semi-Urban Setting in South India: An Antibiotic Resistance in Communities and Hospitals (ARCH) Study.,"Background Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to public health globally. We studied the prevalence of colonization with extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and colistin-resistant Enterobacterales (Col-RE) in hospitals and the surrounding community in South India. Methods Adults from 2 hospitals and the catchment community who consented to provide stool specimens were enrolled. Stools were plated on CHROMagar selective for ESCrE, CRE, and Col-RE. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were done using Vitek 2 Compact and disc diffusion testing. Colistin broth microdilution was performed for a subset of isolates. Prevalence estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and differences were compared across populations using the Pearson χ 2 or Fisher exact test. Results Between November 2020 and March 2022, 757 adults in the community and 556 hospitalized adults were enrolled. ESCrE colonization prevalence was 71.5% (95% CI, 68.1%–74.6%) in the community and 81.8% (95% CI, 78.4%–84.8%) in the hospital, whereas CRE colonization prevalence was 15.1% (95% CI, 12.7%–17.8%) in the community and 22.7% (95% CI, 19.4%–26.3%) in the hospital. Col-RE colonization prevalence was estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI,.5%–2.1%) in the community and 0.5% (95% CI,.2%–1.6%) in the hospital. ESCrE and CRE colonization in hospital participants was significantly higher compared with community participants (P <.001 for both). Conclusions High levels of colonization with antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales were found in both community and hospital settings. This study highlights the importance of surveillance of colonization in these settings for understanding the burden of antimicrobial resistance.","['Kumar, C P Girish', 'Bhatnagar, Tarun', 'Narayanan, G Sathya', 'Swathi, S S', 'Sindhuja, V', 'Siromany, Valan A', 'VanderEnde, Daniel', 'Malpiedi, Paul', 'Smith, Rachel M', 'Bollinger, Susan', 'Babiker, Ahmed', 'Styczynski, Ashley', 'Team, Antibiotic Resistance in Communities and Hospitals India']",,INCLUDE,"The study includes a community population sampled from the catchment area (eligible under primary population criteria) and reports AMR prevalence for Enterobacterales (listed pathogen).

"Prevalence of Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms in Hospitalized and Community Individuals in Bangladesh, a Phenotypic Analysis: Findings From the Antibiotic Resistance in Communities and Hospitals (ARCH) Study.","Background Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) but often lack adequate surveillance to inform mitigation efforts. Colonization can be a useful metric to understand AMR burden. We assessed the colonization prevalence of Enterobacterales with resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, colistin, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among hospital and community dwellers. Methods Between April and October 2019, we conducted a period prevalence study in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We collected stool and nasal specimens from adults in 3 hospitals and from community dwellers within the hospitals' catchment area. Specimens were plated on selective agar plates. Isolates underwent identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing using Vitek 2. We performed descriptive analysis and determined population prevalence estimates accounting for clustering at the community level. Results The majority of both community and hospital participants were colonized with Enterobacterales with resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (78%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 73–83; and 82%; 95% CI, 79–85, respectively). Thirty-seven percent (95% CI, 34–41) of hospitalized patients were colonized with carbapenems compared with 9% (95% CI, 6–13) of community individuals. Colistin colonization prevalence was 11% (95% CI, 8–14) in the community versus 7% (95% CI, 6–10) in the hospital. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization was similar in both community and hospital participants (22%; 95% CI, 19–26 vs 21% (95% CI, 18–24). Conclusions The high burden of AMR colonization observed among hospital and community participants may increase the risk for developing AMR infections and facilitating spread of AMR in both the community and hospital.","['Chowdhury, Fahmida', 'Mah-E-Muneer, Syeda', 'Bollinger, Susan', 'Sharma, Aditya', 'Ahmed, Dilruba', 'Hossain, Kamal', 'Hassan, Md Zakiul', 'Rahman, Mahmudur', 'Vanderende, Daniel', 'Sen, Debashis', 'Mozumder, Palash', 'Khan, Amin Ahmed', 'Sarker, Moushumi', 'Smith, Rachel M', 'Styczynski, Ashley', 'Luvsansharav, Ulzii-Orshikh']",,INCLUDE,"The study includes community dwellers within hospital catchment areas, meeting the primary population criteria.

Clinical characteristics and risk factors for multidrug-resistant bacterial isolation in patients with international travel history.,"• We identified the risk factors for MDRO isolation among returned travelers. • ESBL E. coli (ESBLEC) was detected in about 90% of all MDRO screened patients. • The risk factors for detection were different between ESBLEC and non-ESBLEC MDRO. International travelers are at risk of carrying resistant bacteria. It is critical to identify risk factors associated with multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization in travelers. A retrospective chart review observational study was conducted at two tertiary centers in Japan for inpatients who had been hospitalized or visited an outpatient clinic overseas within the previous 12 months. These patients underwent MDRO screening upon admission. To identify independent predictors for the isolation of MDROs, multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression. In total, 77 (36%) of the 216 patients were positive for MDROs at admission. The majority of bacteria detected in stool samples were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) (n = 67 [89%]). ESBLEC was detected in nearly 40% of patients who traveled to Asia. Travel to Asia was an independent risk factor for any MDRO and ESBLEC isolation. For non-ESBLEC MDRO isolation, a history of surgery abroad was an independent risk factor for detection. A history of hospitalization abroad has previously been found to be associated with MDRO colonization in travelers, which was not identified as a risk factor in this study. The risk factors for MDRO colonization were different between ESBLEC and non-ESBLEC MDROs.","['Moriyama, Yuki', 'Doi, Asako', 'Shinkai, Noriko', 'Nasu, Seiko', 'Mesaki, Kazuhisa', 'Horii, Kumi', 'Ohmagari, Norio', 'Hayakawa, Kayoko']",,EXCLUDE,"The study population consists of international travelers (hospitalized or outpatient with overseas visits within 12 months), which is explicitly excluded under ""SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.""

Neonatal Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the prevalence of colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens in the first 3 months of life in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Key Points: Question: What are the prevalence of and factors associated with colonization with third-generation cephalosporin–resistant Enterobacterales (3GCRE), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) during the first 3 months of life in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)? Findings: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 67 studies including 17 152 individuals, the pooled prevalence of 3GCRE colonization was 30% compared with 3% for CRE and 3% for MRSA colonization. Hospital birth, previous neonatal antibiotic use, and prolonged rupture of membranes were associated with increased risk of 3GCRE colonization. Meaning: The findings suggest substantial prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogen carriage in neonates and infants in LMICs. Importance: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), neonatal bacterial infections are mainly caused by Enterobacterales species and Staphylococcus aureus, which are also the leading causes of mortality directly attributable to antimicrobial resistance. As bacterial colonization often precedes infection, better knowledge of colonization is crucial to prevent antibiotic-resistant neonatal sepsis. Objective: To synthesize current evidence on the prevalence of and factors associated with colonization with third-generation cephalosporin–resistant Enterobacterales (3GCRE), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) during the first 3 months of life in LMICs. Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the World Health Organization Global Index Medicus were searched for articles published from January 1, 2000, through July 29, 2024. Study Selection: Included studies were conducted in LMICs and reported prevalence rates or factors associated with colonization with 3GCRE, CRE, or MRSA in neonates and infants up to 3 months of age. Outbreak reports were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment using a Joanna Briggs Institute tool were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Pooled prevalence for each pathogen was computed using a random-effects model. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of and factors associated with 3GCRE, CRE, and MRSA colonization. Results: Of the 3147 articles identified in the search, 67 studies (51 for 3GCRE and CRE and 16 for MRSA) including 17 152 individuals were eligible. The pooled prevalence of 3GCRE colonization was 30.2% (95% CI, 21.4%-40.7%; τ2 = 1.48; I2 = 95.1%), varying from 18.2% (95% CI, 10.8%-29.1%) in nonhospitalized individuals to 48.2% (95% CI, 36.4%-60.2%) in hospitalized individuals. The prevalence of CRE colonization was 2.6% (95% CI, 0.7%-8.8%; τ2 = 7.79; I2 = 95.6%), while it was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.0%-6.7%; τ2 = 2.58; I2 = 93.5%) for MRSA. Increased risk of colonization with 3GCRE was associated with hospital birth (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.33-2.64), neonatal antibiotic use (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.43-6.11), and prolonged rupture of membranes (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.19-6.84). Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic-resistant pathogen carriage in individuals aged 0 to 3 months, the pooled prevalence was substantial despite a limited exposure period. Although high heterogeneity between studies limited extrapolation of results, the findings highlight the need for further investigation to identify transmission routes and to design targeted and effective preventive measures.","['Beaumont, Anne-Lise', 'Kermorvant-Duchemin, Elsa', 'Breurec, Sébastien', 'Huynh, Bich-Tram']",,EXCLUDE,"The study is a systematic review and meta-analysis, which are explicitly excluded per the exclusion criteria (STUDY TYPES: Systematic reviews/meta-analyses).
